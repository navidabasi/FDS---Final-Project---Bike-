**FDS-Final-Project-Bike-rental-problem
**

This is the notebook in which we did the Bike renting problem in machine learning and analyse it with graphs and other descriptions

Everything is straight forward, first we used a correlation heatmap to filter our dataset from columns that has low/no impact in the process such as atemp and wind speed

then we changed some value types to category that help us to work with our dataset faster (it made it 30% faster)

and after that we started to show the results and compare high or noticable correlations together with supporting materials such as graphs


hint: Since this dataset did not contain specific time values we reformated datetime table to hour and weekdays to research in details.
